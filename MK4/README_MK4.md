MK4 Readme
First posted attempt. Hermetically sealed 8 digit multimeter attempt with low common mode leakage, guarding, ADS1256, LM399, and ADA4523s sprinkled to taste. 
A single, low value shunt resstor is used for all current ranges, resulting in minimal impact on all signals, while also using a LNA to (hopefully) give beautiful performance.
