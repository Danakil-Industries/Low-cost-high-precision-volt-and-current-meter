# Low-cost-high-precision-volt-and-current-meter
My attempts at a high accuracy 8 digit voltmeter and ammeter with low noise and high dynamic range.

Posted attempts start at MK4, which is the first attempt with any sort of input protection. Who would have guessed that input protection would be important?
Most attempts, if not all, will be hermetically sealed. 
All attempts with a LM399/ADR1399 voltage reference are done so purely due to the cost of an LTZ1000 and supporting circutry. The rest of the meter should be able to handle LTZ1000 levels of precision.
The ammeter function was thrown in mostly because of extra avalible space, and to allow for precision power sensing.
